# PM2.5 particle interactive Web-app
Interactive web apps created using leafmap and streamlit

Steps to run – 
-	Git clone the repository.
-	Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
-	Run in the terminal as “Stream-lit run app.py”
Although currently, it is deployed on a streamlit shared platform.

Future steps can be taken – 
-	Streamlit application can be easily deployed on the Heroku platform too.
-	Another deep learning model based on time-series data can be used to improve performance.
-	Sequential series-based models like RNN and LSTM may show some improvement.
-	Representation can be made more effective by showing how many trees are available in the area for particle availability.

Challenges come so far – 
-	Sometimes, openAQ API doesn’t respond well.
-	openAQ API has its limitation with range and response time etc.
-	Since pm2.5 particle prediction is not formulated using ML models, it does not show any pattern or recognizable reference.
